# Kedro project including MLFlow experiment tracking
## Prerequisites
We will be using *pipenv* virtual environment. Let's install it first
```
pip install pipenv
```

Then we want to create a new project and install required dependencies
```
pipenv install
```
This command will install `kedro`, `mlflow`, 'kedro-viz` and other required packages.
Finally, we can enter the virtual env shell.
```
pipenv shell
```

Challenges:
Add plot as artifact
```
```
